            // Question 1:
            //What is the primary purpose of an interface in C#?
            //Answer: b) To define a blueprint for a class

            //Question 2:
            //Which of the following is NOT a valid access modifier for interface members in C#?
            //Answer: a) private

            //Question 3:
            //Can an interface contain fields in C#?
            //Answer: b) No

            //Question 4:
            //In C#, can an interface inherit from another interface?
            //Answer: b) Yes, interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces

            //Question 5:
            //Which keyword is used to implement an interface in a class in C#?
            //Answer: d) implements

            //Question 6:
            //Can an interface contain static methods in C#?
            //Answer: b) No

            //Question 7:
            //In C#, can an interface have explicit access modifiers for its members?
            //Answer: b) No, all members are implicitly public

            //Question 8:
            //What is the purpose of an explicit interface implementation in C#?
            //Answer: a) To hide the interface members from outside access

            //Question 9:
            //In C#, can an interface have a constructor?
            //Answer: b) No, interfaces cannot have constructors

            //Question 10:
            //How can a C# class implement multiple interfaces?
            //Answer: c) By separating interface names with commas
